In this talk, I defined 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) as functorial invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds satisfying particular gluing properties. Every modular tensor category determines a TQFT.

Then I defined 2-dimensional modular functors (MFs). After B-, F-, and Z-moves of parametrizations of 2-dimensional surfaces were defined, it followed that every modular tensor category determines a modular functor with central charge, while a modular functor with central charge defines a weakly ribbon category. 

Finally, I claimed that a 3d TQFT is equivalent to a 2d MF. 

The talk depended on Chapters 3, 4 of Bojko Bakalov, and Alexander A Kirillov. *Lectures on Tensor Categories and Modular Functors*. Vol. 21. American Mathematical Soc., 2001.
