This talk served as an introduction to (co)bordism theory and generalized (co)homology theories. The Pontrjagin-Thom theorem was proved, and the concept of the spectrum of a generalized (co)homology theory is introduced. Finally, I showed that the framed bordism theory is a generalized homology theory. Here are [notes](https://triangdrie.github.io/files/Introduction_to_Bordism_Theory.pdf) for this talk.
