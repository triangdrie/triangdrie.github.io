In the first part of this talk, I introduced the essential data defining a free Batalin-Vilkovisky field theory on a smooth manifold. In the second part, I recalled basics of factorization algebras and revealed that free BV field theories are realizations of factorization algebras. The talk was based largely on [Gwilliam's Thesis](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GwilliamThesis.pdf).


Here is my [notes](https://triangdrie.github.io/files/free_BV_intro.pdf) for this talk.
