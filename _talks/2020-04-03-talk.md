In this talk, following the lines of [Axelrod, Scott, and I. M. Singer. 1994. “Chern-Simons Perturbation Theory. II.” Journal of Differential Geometry 39 (1): 173–213](https://doi.org/10.4310/jdg/1214454681), I introduced a series of topological invariants of 3-manifolds. These invariants are exactly terms in the perturbative expansion of the path integral of the Chern-Simons theory. 

Here are my [notes](https://triangdrie.github.io/files/perturbative_chern_simons.pdf) for this talk.
