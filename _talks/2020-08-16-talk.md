In this talk, I defined the differential cohomology of a smooth manifold using the Cheeger-Simons model. Then I interpreted the action functional of Chern-Simons theory as a differential character in the differential cohomology group. Another model for differential cohomology, the smooth Deligne cohomology, was also introduced. 

Here are [notes](https://triangdrie.github.io/files/diff_cohomology_classical_cs.pdf) for this talk.
