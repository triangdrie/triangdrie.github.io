In this talk, I introduced the concepts of ribbon categories, semi-simple categories and modular categories. The graph calculus in these categories was demonstrated later, and was further used to carefully examine the defining axioms for those categories.

The talk covered the main part of Chapter 2 of Bojko Bakalov, and Alexander A Kirillov. *Lectures on Tensor Categories and Modular Functors*. Vol. 21. American Mathematical Soc., 2001.
