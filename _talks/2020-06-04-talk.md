In this talk, I began by recalling physicists motivation of introducing Atiyah's 2-framing into perturbative Chern-Simons theory. Then I briefly talked obstruction theory for fiber bundles, which is an essential tool for constructing relative characteristic classes for manifolds with boundary. Provided relative Pontrjagin classes for a 4-manifold with boundary, I identified Atiyah's 2-framing as the 2-framing of the boundary 3-manifold of the 4-manifold, minimizing Hirzebruch signature defect of the latter.
