In this talk, I first introduced the Dold-Kan correspondence, which will play an essential role in proving the fibration property of renormalized quantum master equations (rQMEs) over the set of gauge fixing conditions. 

Then, with a gauge fixing condition fixed, I identified the obstruction to a local solution to the rQME, and proved that this obstruction is a BV-closed object. Finally, exploiting the Dold-Kan correspondence, I showed that the set of solutions to rQME is a fiber bundle over the set of gauge fixing conditions, *i.e.* the desired fibration property. 

The talk followed the lines of Sections 9-13 of Kevin Costello's [*Renormalisation and the Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1533).
