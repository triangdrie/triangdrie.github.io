In this talk, I recalled some key concepts in the BV formalism, such as the BV operator, the quantum master equation and the classical master equation, illustrated with examples of 4d Yang-Mills theory and 3d Chern-Simons theory. 

Then I introduced the concepts of regularization and renormalization. To perform the renormalization process of a BV field theory, one must subtract counter terms from the original action functional. At the end of the talk, I proved the existence and locality of a renormalizable BV field theory. 


This talk is based on  Sections 1-9 of Kevin Costello's [*Renormalisation and the Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1533).
