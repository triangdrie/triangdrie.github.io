In this talk, I introduced the concept of gerbes and the Grothendieck topology of gerbes. Connective structures and curvings of a gerbe was defined, as classes in the smooth Deligne cohomology of the gerbe. As an example, the Dixmier-Douady sheaf of groupoids of a principal bundle, which was further a groupoid,  was carefully discussed. 

The talk was based on Chapters 4, 5 of 1. Brylinski J-L. Loop spaces, characteristic classes and geometric quantization. Springer Science & Business Media, 2007.
