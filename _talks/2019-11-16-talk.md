In this talk, I first recalled the Reconstruction Theorem of vertex algebras, then constructed a beta-gamma vertex algebra explicitly from the factorization algebra of the free beta-gamma system. 



This talk followed the lines in Chapter 6 of  [Gwilliam's Thesis](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GwilliamThesis.pdf).
