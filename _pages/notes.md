## Spring 2021

* An Introduction to Computational Algebraic Geometry (Prof. Dingkang Wang)
This is a course I took in Spring 2021. 

The course covered the computation of Gr√∂bner bases, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, and dimension theory in affine algebraic geometry.

Here are [notes](http://triangdrie.github.io/files/comput_ag_notes.pdf) I took while taking this course.
