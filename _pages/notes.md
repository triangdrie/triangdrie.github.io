## Introduction to Computational Algebraic Geometry
This is a course I took in the spring of 2021. 

The course covered the computation of Gr√∂bner bases, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, and dimension theory in affine algebraic geometry.

Here are [notes](http://triangdrie.github.io/files/comput_ag_notes.pdf) I took while taking this course.
