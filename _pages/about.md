I am currently a master student at [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.itp.cas.cn/). 


My research interests lie in quantum field theories and their interactions with geometry and topology. In particular, since I became a graduate student, I have focused on topics including but not limited to Chern-Simons theories (classical and quantum, perturbative and non-perturbative) and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, and their applications in topology. 


I obtained my B. Sc. in Physics from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pxctwsvnnxtg).
